Contributing
============

Any contributions are welcomed! I will be very glad to get your feedback, `pull requests <https://github.com/s3rvac/retdec-python/pulls>`_, `issues <https://github.com/s3rvac/retdec-python/issues>`_, or just a simple *Thanks*. Feel free to contact me for any questions you might have!

Coding Style
------------

The code should be `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ compliant, except for line length, which may be greater than 79 when suitable (but never exceeding 100 characters).

Testing
-------

The code is 100% covered with unit tests. When you make a pull request, please include unit tests for your code to keep the coverage at 100%.

Make Targets
------------

* Project documentation can be generated by running ``make docs`` (you need to have `sphinx <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Sphinx>`_ and `sphinx_rtd_theme <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx_rtd_theme>`_ installed).
* To run unit tests, execute ``make tests`` (you need to have `nose <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose>`_ installed).
* Test coverage can be generated by executing ``make tests-coverage`` (once again, you need to have `nose <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose>`_ installed).
* To ensure that the code complies to `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_, execute ``make lint`` (you need to have `flake8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8>`_ installed).

See the contents of `Makefile <https://github.com/s3rvac/retdec-python/blob/master/Makefile>`_ to for all the possible targets.
